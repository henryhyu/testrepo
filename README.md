## What is This?

This is a "made from scratch" Android Application built with Android Studio. It contains a simple calculator followed by a selection of number conversion quizzes.

## How to Run?

Download the lastest version of Android Studio at the following link: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html. Git clone this repository and open the project folder inside Android Studio and running it should be smooth. Make sure you have the latest SDK installed and updated.

## How does the Application Work?

Run the app by clicking Run on Android Studio. Choose any Android Device as your emulator and the application should start. You will be prompted with a welcome screen, after which you are invited to type in your name and a welcome message will be displayed. Next screen is a simple calculator you can play around with. Following is the quiz itself, which contains checkboxes for the types of conversions (ie. Decimal to Binary or Octal to Hexadecimal) and radio buttons for the length of the quiz (ie. 6 questions, 12 questions, etc.) You will then be prompted with the quiz interface itself, where a number is given and the user will be prompted to type in the correct conversion. A "Change Number" feature is added if the current problem is too difficult.
